# balloonomancy design document

Welcome to the design document for my working card game, balloonamancy!

This simple website is where I organize documents regarding game rules, mechanic details, plans and general design musings to be shared with tears and the public at Large.

Many areas will feel a little crude and more like a journal but I'll try to be as neat and organized as I can, especially with hard game rules.

This site can be navigated by the sidebar to your left or from the top left corner if you're viewing this on mobile. You can also search for notes using the search bar on the top right.
