So this is a design concept I've learned about before starting this iteration of the game, and acts as the main way I think about card design and the design of the styles.

So in most all games where strategies center around committing resources into game actions, your strategic decisions can be abstracted down to 3 general axis:

- Rush: Spend resources to win NOW.
- Economy: Spend resources to gain more resources and win later.
- Defense: Spend resources to not lose.

These axis also exist in a rock-paper-scissors relationship. a player trying to rush in and spend available resources to win now can be thwarted by efficiently spending resources to defend against them, and come out of it with a greater resource advantage.

A player trying to spend resources to build their own resources to win with later will be occupied and open to efforts to rush in and try to win from under them.

and a player trying to turtle hard and stall leaves you free to accumulate resources to then overwhelm their defenses with.

## How this is applied to this game
