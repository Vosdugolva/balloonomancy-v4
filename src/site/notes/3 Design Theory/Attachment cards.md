# Attachment Cards

So I've been doing some research and development on the idea of object cards that can be connected to a balloon to give that one balloon added abilities. this on paper would be a nice addition for tall strategies, the question is how to best execute this idea.

## MTG Auras

Auras in Magic the gathering are a simple example of this sort of thing, where the spell is played attached to a creature, and goes away when the creature does.

There's just a few problems:
1. If you have no creature to play this on, the card is a dud in your hand.
2. when the creature is destroyed, that's 2 cards lost for you.

And those are no small problems either, for as simple as this idea may be, it does have multiple points of failure, and in a 40 deck game they take up valuable space for cards that rely on other cards on the field to even enter the field. I feel like to make them worth it, I'd have to really crank up the value on them like it is with modern auras in MTG, where they grant insane powers or a bunch of keywords.

## Equipment/Cross Gears

These were card types introduced latter on, Equipment in particular being designed to address the above mentioned issues Auras have.

what these have in common is that you first pay to put them onto the field, then pay again to attach it onto a creature. and if the creature is destroyed then these simply detatch and stay on the field, ready to put onto another creature.

This approach may work better in our game, especially when these cards are all called "Objects" anyways.
