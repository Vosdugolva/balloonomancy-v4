# Attack Phases

Now we get to the heart of the game! The attack-response pattern is one of the biggest distinctions this game has against it's inspiration, and where it's dodgeball framing matters most.

So once an attack is declared, The player and their target enters a sequence of steps in which initiative goes back and forth and several actions can be taken, let's go over them all:

1. Initiation Step
2. Response Step
3. Counter Response step
4. Resolution Step
	1. Clash 
	2. Stamina Check 

Within the Attack phase, both players get the opportunity to play only one battle action.
## 1.4.1 Initiation step

When the attacking player has spent their attacking balloon and declared their target. The attack phase begins between the attacking player and the defending player.

In the initiation step, the first thing that happens before anything is that balloon effects that trigger when the balloon attacks are resolved. typically this is only on the attacking balloon but some balloons may have effects that fire off when any other balloon initiates an attack.

After effects resolve, the attacking player has the option to play their one battle action to lead in with the attacking balloon. weather they do or not, we move onto the next step

## 1.4.2 Response Step

Initiative moves to the defending player, and they have an opportunity to take actions to try and avoid the attacking balloon and end the attack phase before having to do a stamina check. currently the defending player has 2 actions available to them that can be done at any order:
1. Play a battle action card.
2. Declare a blocker.

### 1.4.2.1 Play a battle action
The defending player has the opportunity to play only one battle action in response to the attacking balloon. the goal may be to end the attack early by **Avoiding** the attacking balloon, or by removing the balloon from the attacking player's board.

other cases the battle action may just give the player opportunity to build advantage at the expense of getting hit, or effect the attacking player's board in retaliation.

If the attacking balloon is avoided or removed at this point, the attack phase ends and returns to the main phase of the active player.

### 1.4.2.2 Declare a blocker
The defending player may declare a blocker by spending a balloon on their field with the **Blocker** ability, either one they naturally have or one gained temporarily by card effects.

When a blocker is declared, the attacking balloon's target is switched to the blocker.

## 1.4.3 Counter Response step

Initiative returns to the attacking player, and they get their last chance to play a battle action if they didn't play one during the initiation step. this can allow the attacking player to respond to and try and maneuver around chosen blockers or battle actions.

note: Battle Actions resolve the moment they are played. so timing is important if the attacking player wants to try and prevent their balloon from being blocked, avoided, or removed by the defending player's battle action.

## 1.4.4 Resolution step
The final part of the attack sequence, and this sequence basically moves on to one of 2 different phases/events depending on who the attacking balloon is targeting.
- If the final target is another balloon, The two balloons enter a **Clash**
- if the final target is a rival player, the rival player performs a **Stamina Check**

This all sounds super technical and overwhelming, but is actually pretty fluid to do in play. this helps to mainly dispel any ambiguity on what you can and cannot do and when.
