# Stamina Check

A stamina check occurs when a balloon has a clear shot at a rival player. and the check represents a last ditch effort to react to the rubber monster closing in on you.

The rules of a stamina check are as follows:
1. cards in the stamina line are revealed and resolved one at a time from the top of the line down.
2. If cards have no stamina effect, it goes to your hand.
3. If cards do have a stamina effect, resolve it.
4. after you perform a stamina check and you have no cards in your stamina line, you are eliminated.

1.6.1 Stamina effects

There are currently 3 stamina effects

- Avoid
	- The revealed stamina card with this effect goes to your hand and is immediately replaced with a new card from the top of your deck. this is **not optional**
- React
	- You have the choice of either putting the card into your hand or playing it immediately at no cost in retaliation. either way, the hit counts and the card leaves your stamina line with no replacement.
- Counter
	- combination of the two above, where you may play it for free or add it to your hand, but whichever you choose, the stamina card is immediately replaced with a new card from the top of your deck. again, this is **not optional**
