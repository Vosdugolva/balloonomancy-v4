# 1.3 Turn Phases

So when the game begins, the player goes through a number of phases each with their own steps, in order they are:

- Start Phase
	- Ready step
	- Setup step
	- Draw step
- Main Phase
- End phase

## 1.3.1 Start Phase
The 3 steps in the start phase are all done in a specific order
1. **Ready step** is when you restore all spent cards on your field, balloon cards, objects, breath cards. and such
2. **Setup step** is when you resolve all start of turn effects.
3. **Draw step** is when you draw a card from the top of your deck.

## 1.3.2 Main Phase

So here's where things get tricky, Main phase doesn't have a set of steps so much as a list of actions you can take that initiate their own phases you must go through before returning to the main phase. it's tricky to explain from a rulesy angle but easy to figure out.

anyways, your Main phase actions include:
- Add to Breath (once per turn)
- inflate balloons on your field
- Attack a Rival player or their spent balloons
- Play cards from your hand
- trigger card effects on your field
- End the Main Phase.

### 1.3.2.1 Add to Breath
This is something you are allowed to do once per turn normally. take a card from your hand and put it into the breath zone face up.
### 1.3.2.2 inflate balloons on your field.
A key and so far unique mechanic of this game is the fact that you can store resources into creatures to increase their power.

Maybe it's not super unique depending on how you think about it but the framing is that your creatures are balloons and so you blow them up bigger to make them larger and more powerful.

As many times as you're able to during your turn, you may pay one breath to put a breath counter on one of your balloons. Details regarding this will be explored in another note.
### 1.3.2.3 Attack a rival player or spent rival balloons
This is where the meat of the game begins, and the attack sequence will be explained in another note.

basically, this is when you can initiate an attack with one of your balloons by spending it, and either sending it after a player or after one of their spent balloons.

Balloons that enter play are stiff and cannot attack until your next turn.

You can attack as often as you are able to in your main phase.

### 1.3.2.4 Play cards from your hand
Your allowed to play as many cards as you can afford to play, pay the cost in breath, play the card down onto the field, resolve it's effects, and then put it wherever it goes on your field. simple stuff.

Card types and their play rules will be covered in another note.
### 1.3.2.5 trigger card effects on your field
Cards on your field that can be spent (ie: tapped) to do something can be used during your turn as often as you are allowed to.
### 1.3.2.6 End your Main Phase
Once you've done everything you can or want to do, end your main phase and wrap up your turn.

## 1.3.3 End Phase
Typically not a ton to do here, resolve any effects that trigger when your turn ends, and then finally pass your turn to the next player in your turn order.
