# 1.1 Building a deck

So the deckbuilding rules of this game are pretty simple, you are limited to a deck of **40 cards total**, with no more than **3 copies** of the same card with the same name and attributes.

In time the rules may shift to being as low as 40, but up to 60 cards. though the 3 card per copy rule will be the same.

So those are the hard rules but let's also talk about actual effective deckbuilding, like how should one make a deck that will feasibly work out.

So I have a standard deck template of sorts that I use when I make the prototype decks, it came from my time exploring Kaijudo (The main inspiration for this iteration of the game). it goes like this:

- 7 balloon cards cost 1-2
	- usually 3 different ones.
- 7 Balloon cards cost 3
	- Again, usually 3 different ones.
- 7 Balloon cards cost 4
	- Same as above
- 4-6 Balloon cards cost 5+
	- usually I do 2 different big balloons

That's in total 25-27 balloons in your deck. with the remaining 15-13 cards being reserved for action cards and object cards that help with your core strategy.

This is mostly a good way to start a functional deck, and can be refined and adjusted later, maybe with fewer balloons and more non-balloon cards or vice versa.
