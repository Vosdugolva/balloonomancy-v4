# 1.2 Setting up the game

So this is a game that can be played by up to 4 players (technically you can do more but 4 seems the most feasible). all players must bring with them their 60 card deck, and objects to track breath counters (dice work fine)

Each player begins by shuffling their deck, and drawing 5 cards to make up their starting hand. then place five cards in their stamina line to act as their hitpoints.

once that is done, you decide who goes first, and begin the game with turns rotating between players in a circle.

## 1.2.1 How to win the game

The goal of the game is to have all of your opposing players draw all 5 of their stamina line cards, they are eliminated once their stamina line is empty. the **ONLY** way to do this is to land hits with your balloons, either 5 clean hits or a few with balloons that strike multiple times.

The last player standing is the winner.
