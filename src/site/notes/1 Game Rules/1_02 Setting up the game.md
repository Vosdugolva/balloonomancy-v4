# 1.2 Setting up the game

So this is a game that can be played by up to 4 players (technically you can do more but 4 seems the most feasible). all players must bring with them their 60 card deck, and objects to track breath counters (dice work fine)

## 1.2.1 How to start the game
Each player begins by shuffling their deck, and drawing 5 cards to make up their starting hand. then place five cards in their stamina line to act as their hitpoints.

once that is done, you decide who goes first, and begin the game with turns rotating between players in a circle.

## 1.2.2 How to win the game

The goal of the game is to have all of your opposing players draw all 5 of their stamina line cards, they are eliminated once their stamina line is empty. the **ONLY** way to do this is to land hits with your balloons, either 5 clean hits or a few with balloons that strike multiple times.

The last player standing is the winner.

## 1.2.3 Game Zones

Each Player's play space is broken up into 5 main zones
- **Battle Zone**: Often referred to as "The Field" on card effects. this is where cards are played into and exist 'in the game'. this is the largest zone on your play area and has no rules regarding how cards can be positioned in it (but be organized for the sake of your rival players)
- **Breath zone**: Positioned just below the Battle zone, this is where cards are placed to act as your resource for playing cards. Cards enter the breath zone face up. with the color of the card being significant for Commitment values. 
- **Stamina line**: Typically positioned to the right of the Battle zone (but can be on the left if that is more convenient.). Here cards are placed face down and vertically in a line going from top down. these cards act as your hitpoint. and drawing the last one without being able to replace it means you lose.
- **Deck and Discard pile**: these two zones are located below the stamina line and are in line with your breath zone. your main deck is shuffled and placed face down into this area with a pile of used and discarded cards being placed beside it. Cards in your discard pile remain face up and are public knowledge. the order of the cards in your discard pile is irrelevant to game rules.
