# 2.2.2 green style

Vibes
- very naturish and druidic in aesthetic 
	- I think the proper term is Celtic, although that's mainly with the first deck
- it's definitely foils purple in a nature magic versus arcane magic sort of deal.
	- water, wind, and Earth. Mostly wind though.
- not just Forest nature, also cares about jungle nature, and with the direction blue is going, green may also be the color for big ocean creatures too.
	- possibly desert nature too
- it's very much all about big fantastic creatures
- I'm not sure if I put dragons in dinosaurs into green exclusively anymore, green used to be the big reptile color but
	- I think I want dinosaurs as a green / red archetype and dragons as green / purple
