Balloons with blocker are able to be spent during an attack to switch the intended target to the blocker, simple stuff really.

- Standard cost: 2
- Value neutral: no
- Available to all colors, favored in Green and blue

Blocker used to be considered a **Value Neutral Ability**, in that a balloon with blocker was believed to not be that much better than a vanilla balloon of the same cost, and so having it shouldn't incur any downsides or penalties. My stance on this has changed. Blockers may not be much early on but they gain in value later in game, where they may act as a last line of defense for you, as well as an enabler for other balloons to go on the offensive. a single blocker can ward off attacks or at least buy time for an offensive balloon to tale a swing and avoid reprisal.

Blocker are generally at their most valuable at the cost of 2. or at least that's what I think. however a large blocker has considerable utility since it being on the board tells the opponent that if you swing at you, they will lose one of their balloons in the process. and typically decks don't have more than one balloon they want to attack with.

Typically an ideal control end game is to have an attacker surrounded by blockers, this is the sort of situation that green likes to be in. where it attacks with one balloon surrounded by blockers able to keep it safe from attacking balloons.
