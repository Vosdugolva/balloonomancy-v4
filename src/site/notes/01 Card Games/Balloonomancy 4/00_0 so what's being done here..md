So I am declaring this as balloonamancy version 4, version 3 was built off of lorcana as a base game, here though, I'm building off of Duel Masters and kaijudo.

So the reasons for this are as follows:
- both games are hot on my mind as of writing since I've been collecting cards and learning about the game more.
- there's been a natural gravity towards this direction with version 3
	- I want the streamlined simplicity that these games have
	- I want the excitement that comes from revealing shield triggers.
	- I enjoy the more creature-based gameplay where boards it up is faster and attacking is more immediate.
