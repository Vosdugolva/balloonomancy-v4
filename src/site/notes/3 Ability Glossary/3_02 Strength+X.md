# 3.2 Strength+X

Balloons with Strength+X are treated as being X sizes higher whenever they are attacking or blocking

- standard cost: 2
- Value neutral: Yes, somewhat
- Somewhat signature in red, but purple has been using it too.

So Strength+X used to only boost size when attacking, with Guard+X being the blocking equivalent. but Guard+X was redundant as an ability on it's own since it can't function without also being with blocker. so I combined it into Strength+X as a secondary bonus.

I initially undervalued it at first, strength+x is kinda meaningless when you are attacking the player and it doesn't do anything until the balloon is ready to attack, and in a red vs red mirror match both sides are just attacking and dodging each other most of the time. it's much more useful when it comes to on the board trading since you get a balloon that innately swings higher than normal.

as for how much a balloon should have, so the way I think about it is that it's like if a balloon actually has 2 sizes for offense and defense, strength+x by itself is like moving one size "stat" from your defense to your offense side.

say you have 2 size 3's, one has a limit of 3 and one has a limit of 2 with Strength+2. when both are fully inflated, the vanilla is a size 6 weather it is attacking/blocking, or is being attacked while spent. the other one however is a size 7 while attacking/blocking, but size 5 while being attacked.

now of course, you can have a size 3 with Strength+2 and a limit of 3 still, but that means it's likely got a commitment pip. but this more committed balloon get's to be a size 6 while being attacked, but when attacking/blocking it shoots up to a size 8.

this size 3 could also have Strength+3 but that means it's losing 2 points in it's limit, or has 2 commitment pips. easy in mono-red but likely tricky for a mixed color deck.
