# 3.7 Expandable

Can be considered the inverse of Expansion, Expandable makes the existing object (or balloon) be an expansion host for any balloon of the appropriate class, including those that don't have expansion.

- standard cost: 1
- Value neutral: somewhat
- Available to all colors.

So this is mainly on objects that represent either flat balloons or packages holding a deflated balloon. and the idea comes from a card type in duel masters known as Tamaseeds.

To cut to the chase: Expandable objects stand in as the game's preferred turn 1 play. these objects do something on entry, and afterwards act as a base for you to play a balloon onto at a reduced cost.

so far most just search the top 3-5 cards for it's associated balloon, or let you draw a card. but I've been dabbling in some more interesting ones.

I've yet to put this on a balloon but the design space is open for when I decide to pursue it.
