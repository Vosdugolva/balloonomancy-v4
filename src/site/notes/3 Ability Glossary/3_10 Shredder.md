My time fooling around with Kaijudo has taught me the value of this ability, and I take it seriously here. Shredder is a deceptively useful ability for both offense and defense.

Balloons with Shredder are guaranteed to trade, which means opponents have to think twice about blocking with it or swinging into it after it attacks, it can get away with being offensively reckless.

Meanwhile, Shredder is the hardest form of removal in the game. where most of your options include bounce, bounce-with-extra steps, and spot removal for overinflated balloons or balloons with low limits. shredder will takes something off the board no questions asked.

needless to say, I'm a bit sparring with how I distribute this ability.
