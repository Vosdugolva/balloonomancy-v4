# 3.8 Evasive

A returning ability from version 2, Evasive makes it so a balloon cannot be attacked or blocked by one that is smaller than it.

- Standard cost: 2, though been going up to 3
- Value neutral: not exactly
- Not exclusive to any color, not really favored by anyone either yet.

So on paper, it seems simple enough, but I've been having a hard time finding a good use for this in play.

Like, an evasive is able to freely attack against opponent with boards full of big balloons, and won't have to worry about getting hit back. and yet, I haven't found that to be super useful yet.

for one, you're actively discouraged from inflating it because that makes it vulnerable, for another thing it's a big target for spot removal, and with a lot of it being size based, this means it will never be safe from being gusted or shuriken'd. and lastly, there aren't many cases where being able to sneak past a big blocker is meaningful. in a lot of those circumstances you're usually in a bad way anyways, and so you might get that one hit, but then be open to 3 balloons ready to dogpile you.
