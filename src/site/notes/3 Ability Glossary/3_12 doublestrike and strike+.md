3.12 Multi strike abilities 

Standard cost: 5
Value neutral: for the most part
Universal across all colors.

These multi-strike abilities basically allow a balloon to check more than one stamina card against arrival player. Strike plus is seen as additive and is mostly granted by card effects. Double strike is the innate ability that balloons have and if functionally identical to strike Plus one, just utilizing different language.

Currently, double strike is treated as something just built into balloons size 5 and up, and isn't something that cuts into their power budget.

This mostly mirrors how it's analog in kaijudo is handled. Where double breaker is just granted onto creatures that have 6,000 power. Add higher break values correlate with power values in divisions of 6000.

It's sort of like saying this creature is so strong that it breaks two of your Shields instead of one

Back to this game, multi-strike abilities typically show up on late game balloons and win conditions, and mostly favored tall strategies that want to win with one or two balloons.

A balloon with double strike only needs to attack a player three times to finish them off, at least so long as they don't reveal any Dodge cards.

Currently there is no triple strike but I feel like if I were to have that I would put that on balloons size 8 and up.
