# 4.1 Value Neutral Abilities

So generally I use vanilla balloons as a baseline for balancing however are some limitations with that design principle that can lead to making cards unnecessarily weak. So now I'm looking to declare a new design idea of **value neutral abilities**

The idea of a value neutral ability is that it's an ability that technically makes a balloon better than vanilla but not meaningfully so, and as such they should be considered effectively free when it comes to exchanging stats for them.

Abilities that I consider value neutral so far:
- Airtap
- BreathScale
