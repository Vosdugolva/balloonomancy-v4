# 4.4 balloon sizes and their significance 

## Size 2
the lowest basic size for balloons
early game plays, and in later points you're able to start throwing down 2 of them. That's something to think about with these.

Generally they shouldn't do anything that effects the field right away. Size 2 balloons should generally have effects that require some form of follow up since the balloons themselves are cheap to get down.

## Size 3
This is where I tend to want to put balloons with substantial on play effect at the lowest 

## Size 4

## Size 5

## Size 6+
