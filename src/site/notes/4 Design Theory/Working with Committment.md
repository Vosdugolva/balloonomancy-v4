# Working with Commitment

So Commitment is this game's approach to enforcing deckbuilding pressure that limits the player's ability to just freely pull from all color divisions during deckbuilding. the idea itself is actually an extension of Kaijudo's mana system. where all cards in the mana zone can pay for any card just so long as you have one card of the matching color in your mana zone.


Commitment takes this a step further, where some cards have 0 commitment and do not care about what colors are in your breath zone. while other cards have 2 or more, expecting that your deck is heavily weighted towards that color.

There's a couple of ways in which I use commitment.

## 1. Have More potent low cost balloons.

So Typically, a Vanilla balloon with no effects would have it's limit equal to it's size, and when abilities are added to it, it must trade them by either reducing it's limit, or gaining commitment pips.

You want a size 3 balloon with Strength+2 and Speedy? well you've got 3 options:
- One has a limit of 1
- One has 2 commitment pips
- one has  a limit of 2 and a downside ability

2 commitment pips for a monocolored deck is nothing. but in a deck running 2 or more colors that can be potentially inconvenient. it could be turn 3 but your 3 breath cards are in the wrong color. or on the way to turn 3. the one card of the matching color is a card you want to use later on. so then you gotta make some tough choices.

The other two options are more splashable as they both have 0 commitment, but they do have the downside of having a low limit or some negative ability that imparts further limitations.

## 2. Low cost cards gated by how early they can be played.

This is something I do a lot with action cards, cards that only cost 1 or 2 but end up with commitment values higher than their breath cost. thus while they are cheap, you can't throw them down as soon as turn 1
