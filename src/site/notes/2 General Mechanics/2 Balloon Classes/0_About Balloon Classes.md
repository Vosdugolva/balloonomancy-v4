# About Balloon Classes

So in Balloonomancy, Balloons are defined and categorized by their class. this is equivalent to creature races from other card games except they're driven more by a shared theme/aesthetic given that they are not only artificial but made by and for each of the styles they primarily exist in.

Each style has their own set of balloon classes, with each class serving as a means of expressing the major game mechanics and playstyles that color focuses on.

Balloons can have more than one class, and in the future I plan on playing with this for cross color mechanics.

## Classes by style
### Red
- [[2 General Mechanics/2 Balloon Classes/1_About Giant Bats\|Giant Bat]]
- [[2 General Mechanics/2 Balloon Classes/2_About Bigfoots\|BigFoot]]

### Green
- [[2 General Mechanics/2 Balloon Classes/3_About Guardians\|Guardian]]
- [[2 General Mechanics/2 Balloon Classes/4_About Wind Sages\|Wind Sage]]

### Purple
- [[2 General Mechanics/2 Balloon Classes/5_About SpellBeasts\|SpellBeast]]
- [[2 General Mechanics/2 Balloon Classes/6_About Mage Creatures\|Mage Creature]]

### Blue

- [[2 General Mechanics/2 Balloon Classes/8_About Shikigami\|Shikigama]]

# Intersectional Balloon Classes

So this is something for the future, but an intersectional balloon class is basically just a balloon class that is shared by 2 colors normally, the idea is that these are balloon classes that have overlapping themes and mostly deal in overlapping mechanics between the two styles.
