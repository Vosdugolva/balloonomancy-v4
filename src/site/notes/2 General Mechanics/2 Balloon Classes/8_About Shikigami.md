Balloons styled after Creatures of (mostly eastern) Folklore, Shikigami act as dutiful protectors for their given balloonomancer, and bring great misfortune to whoever threatens them. more than just look the part, these balloons wield strange magic to confuse, misdirect, and expose rival balloonomancers while safeguarding their own.

Shikigami are a more defensive balloon class that's heavier on blockers, but also carry a lot of discard and hostile hand manipulation as well as other control flavored mechanics from soft removal to even some lockdown effects.
