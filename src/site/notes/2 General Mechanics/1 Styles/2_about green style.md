# Green style

Green is framed as being very nature magic themed. it's one of 2 styles with a strong magical framing, this one is more about fantastical creatures and controlling the elements (mainly wind.)

Currently the deck leans more towards a Druidic/Celtic sort of aesthetic but I do want to go beyond just that down the road. like I want Green to be all about big, fancy balloon monsters that get gigantic.

Mechanics wise, Green is the ramp color, it wants to build up one or more gigantic balloons and swing over opponents with a single, strong, hard to deal with creature. in time this has lead green into being more of a control color, where it's endgame is to get a stacked creature, and the path to it involves setting up blockers and bouncing threats that may interfere with your growth.

I also want to push green into being a color that cares about inflate tokens and messing around with them. and there's also thoughts about trying to make something resembling MTG Voltron, where a bunch of object cards are used to target and buff a single creature into being a big threat. adding more dynamics to the whole tall strategy beyond just adding more and more breath tokens onto a balloon.
