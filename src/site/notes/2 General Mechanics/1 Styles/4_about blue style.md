# Blue style

Blue was the last color to be developed, and took a long time to figure out the identity of it. eventually after musing on an earlier direction that was more ninja influenced, I decided to revisit it full on and now here we are.

So blue is a style of balloonomancy frames as being both eastern in influence and very performative by nature, players utilize gadgets, throwing objects, flashy acrobatics and ninja tricks to evade attacking balloons, meanwhile balloons of the blue style are armed with foam or wooden weapons to extend their reach and strike opposing players in a way that's technically legal but also very fun to watch. 

Blue is the style of all the cool eastern stuff, ninjitsu, martial arts, Yokai, Flashy swordsmen, and a dash of mysticism. all of which culminates into a more reactive control color that wants to win through attrition. Blue plays defensively and tries to sabotage foes through discard and removal before bringing down some fast and powerful threats to clean things up in the late game.

Blues main draw is it's ability to make itself untouchable for a turn, and the Quick keyword which lets other cards be playable as battle actions. Blue like to dodge and evade like red does but it also loves it's blockers too. Blue also specializes in deflation, which is bounce but with extra steps. and likes using shredder to trade with it's rivals.

Blue has a lot of no-nonsense beaters as it's top end, cards that can get around blockers or ignore attempts to avoid them. but does need to stall till it can start throwing them down. Blue is also actively incentivized to not take hits as much as it can with cards and balloons that scale base on the number of stamina cards you have, getting weaker with the fewer you are left with.

Blue is a late game color like green. however while green wants to accelerate into the late game, blue has to take it's time until it's able to start dropping heavy hitters.
