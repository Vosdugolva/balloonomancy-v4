# Purple style 

Purple is another magic-centric color but is more on the wizardry/scholarly side of things. where instead of druids and hippies you've got nerds. Being kinda smart and heady is a part of the aesthetic of purple. along with themes of divination and stuff like that.

Purple is probably the color I'm most invested in from a mechanical standpoint as it's more of an original idea for this game. some would call it aggro with combo elements but I moreso see Purple as the "Burst Damage" Color. it wants to win through unleashing insane offensive pressure, but at the risk of burning itself out. and what I mean by that is that Purple favors having aggressive deck searching at the cost of milling itself, or milling itself to take a card it wants out of discard, or removing cards in it's breath zone to gain an advantage. it's got tools to strike hard and strike aggressively. but will put itself at an extreme resource deficit if the effort fails.

a lot of purple's design also comes from trying to have the utility of token creature in a game that doesn't actually use token creatures. this is what the SpellBeast archetype is about, where they can be searched and pulled from discard rather liberally compared to other balloons, but that benefit is mostly reserved for them.

Purple is kinda like red in that it prefers to play action cards to avoid taking hits, but purple is also set as the only color able to gain stamina cards, framed as the player putting up magic barriers that negate a hit. it sounds kinda cheaty but that's how purple players play.
