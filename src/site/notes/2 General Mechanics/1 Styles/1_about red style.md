#  Red style

So red style is framed as being very athletic, very body focused, it's the style that takes the whole dodgeball framing to heart and approaches the sport as a pure physical sport. where players are frantically running, ducking, and weaving, and catching and throwing their balloons at each other.

I kinda see red as the "warrior" Class of the 4 colors. it's all about raw physical abilities rather than fancy tricks or magic. more about playing an honest game, relatively speaking.

Mechanics wise, Red is aimed at being a more tempo centric color, it wants to get the most out of it's resources and create an increasingly potent board state. it's strategy is to maximize offensive pressure by having all or most all of it's balloons on offense. and rely on using action cards and preparing the stamina line with dodge cards to protect it from taking hits. Red still has blockers but generally wants all balloons to be able to attack.

Red also likes to force players to interact or be open to interaction. if someone tries to pillow fort or sit on precious balloons, red has ways to force their hand or act on their board weather they want to or not.
