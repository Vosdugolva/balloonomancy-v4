# Undodgeable

- Standard cost: N/A
- Value neutral: Absolutely not
- Universal across all colors.

So undodgeable was a mechanic in the 3rd iteration that didn't get messed with too much, Functionally what this ability does is ignore effects that let the target player avoid the attacking balloon. action cards that say "avoid the attacking balloon" will fail if used, and the **Avoid** and **Counter** Stamina triggers basically don't go off if the balloon with undodgeable checks them.

This is powerful but in a way that can seem a little uninteractive, it basically shuts out 2 of the 3 main defensive hurdles a balloon has to get through to get a hit.

I've been dabbling with an alternate idea that is weaker and only targets one, [[2 General Mechanics/3 Ability Glossary/14 Pressure\|Pressure]].
