# Quick

A new ability in the works, Quick allows the card with the keyword to be able to be played as a battle action.

- standard cost: none
- Value neutral: not really
- Signature ability of blue

So this is a new ability as of writing, and I'm still figuring it out. basically it lets a non-battle action card be played as a battle action. there are a lot of theoretical use cases but so far in my experimentation with the blue deck, I find it to be mainly useful on 2 other card types

- Basic Actions
	- Basic actions with quick can now be used in both timing, which boosts versatility in more ways than I expected.
- Objects
	- You get to throw down a persistent card that does something on entry, and can be utilized in later turns.

Surprisingly, I haven't found a good use case for balloons with the quick keyword yet. Objects can get away with stronger on-play effects because they aren't balloons that can attack and block. balloons run into an issue where to have meaningful effects with quick means the balloon is likely to cost 3 at the lowest. and 3 is really expensive for battle actions.
