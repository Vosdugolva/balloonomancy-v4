# BreathScale

Balloons with breath scale gain an increase to their limit by +1 for each card in your breath zone.

- standard cost: 1
- Value neutral: for the most part
- Signature of green

This was an older ability brought back from the past 2 iterations to great effect here. Breathscale basically allows green to inevitably out scale it's rivals and win by going over everyone with gigantic, night unstoppable balloons.

Breathscale does require investment, and is why I consider it value neutral. because what good is having a limit of 10 if you aren't prepared to inflate a balloon that large.
