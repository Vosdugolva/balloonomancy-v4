*"During a clash, this balloon wins if it is holding more breath than the defending balloon"*

So PowerVolume has been a longstanding ability thruought the many iterations of this game, in fact it's original effect is now just a natural part of the game now that a balloon's size doubles as it's power value. still I've been flirting with this idea where some balloons got more value out of inflate tokens than others.

so the basic idea with power volume is that it changes the base rules of who wins in a clash. instead of size it's purely the number of inflate tokens. so a size 3 with power volume will beat a size 6 if the size 3 has at least 1 inflate token while the size 6 has none.

So how does this compare against [[2 General Mechanics/3 Ability Glossary/2 Strength+X\|Strength+X]]? well PowerVolume requires investment while strength+X doesn't. a balloon with Strength+2 is perpetually bigger by 2 sizes whenever it attacks or blocks.

PowerVolume may be easier to thwart than Strength+X. if the size 3 has a limit of 3 and the size 6 has a limit of 6. then the size 6 just needs 4 inflate tokens to consistently swing over the size 3 with PowerVolume. if the size 3 had Strength+2 instead.  it would attack and block at a size of 8 when fully inflated. meanwhile the size 6 would only need...3 inflate tokens at least. Okay so maybe PowerVolume is more efficient than Strength+X. but I'll have to see of testing.
