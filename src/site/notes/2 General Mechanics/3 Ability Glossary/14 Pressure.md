# Pressure
- standard cost : 3 for now
- Value neutral: not really
- Mainly reserved for red and green for now

When a balloon with Pressure attacks a rival player, that player is unable to play battle actions during the attack, leaving them to either use a blocker, or hope for a stamina trigger.

It's meant to be a weaker version of [[2 General Mechanics/3 Ability Glossary/13 Undodgeable\|Undodgeable]], although it's ruling does have a unique attribute to it. Undodgeable lets players play battle actions, it just ignores the effects that avoid the balloon. Pressure just stops all battle actions from being played, which would include things like blue's deflating battle actions.

speaking of, there's a question of weather [[2 General Mechanics/3 Ability Glossary/11 Quick\|quick]] cards get through simply because they aren't explicitly labeled as battle actions. It probably should so maybe the ability should state that you cannot play any card in response to the attacking balloon.
