# Speedy 

It's basically haste/rush, the balloon gets to attack as soon as it enters play.

- standard cost: 3
- Value neutral: fucking no!
- So far settling on it being Blues main thing, red and purple kinda mess with it also.

In earlier drafts this ability was just our equivalent to MTG's Flying, where only other speedies could block it. I might just rename it Rush or Haste because those sound better.

Anyways it's pretty straightforward as to what it does, and because of that I tend to avoid giving it to anything sized 2 or less. By turn 3 is when most players will have answers to a balloon that comes in and attacks right away so I tend to feel more comfortable about it being at that cost range.

it's somewhat in competition against the fact that balloons attack right away if they come in as expansions. but at least a 2 drop coming in on a 1 cost item has given advanced warning, and involves the player investing 2 cards into it.
