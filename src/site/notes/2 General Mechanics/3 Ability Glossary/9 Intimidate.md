# Intimidate

Another returning ability from version 2 and a functional inverse of [[2 General Mechanics/3 Ability Glossary/8 Evasive\|Evasive]]. Intimidate means you cannot be attacked or blocked by smaller balloons.

- Standard cost: 3
- Value neutral: not quite
- So far it's neither exclusive nor favored by any color

So this version of Intimidate is a bit different in that it only stops the carrier from being targeted by smaller balloons, instead of it's earlier drafts which stopped smaller balloons from targeting anything on your field. though this version feels only marginally more useful than evasive.

Mostly all it really does is keep the balloon from being chump blocked, or removed by a smaller balloon with shredder. it's arguably more valuable for offense than defense.
