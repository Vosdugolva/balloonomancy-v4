*"When this balloon attack a player, is blocked, and wins the clash, it starts a new attack against that player again."*

So this ability is an attempt at having something akin to [trample](https://draftsim.com/trample-mtg/) from MTG, where a large enough balloon is able to plow right through a weaker balloon and gun it for the player. I also want to make it something that's less of a deterrent to blocking and more of a thing you can actually use with combat tricks.

so the long of it is that when you target a rival player and attack with a balloon that has crusher, if the opponent choses a blocker and the blocker loses, the attaching balloon initiates a new attack sequence against the target player immediately after winning. this comes with a new chance to pick blockers or play battle actions. so the idea is if you can swing with a balloon that looks blockable, they choose a blocker, and then you play an action that either grants crusher or the power to win the clash. the balloon pops and the attack sequence starts all over, meaning the defending player now has to pull something else up or else take the hit.
