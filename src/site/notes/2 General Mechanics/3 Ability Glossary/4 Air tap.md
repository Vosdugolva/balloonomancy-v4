# Air tap 

So there kinda exists 2 different versions of this ability in design right now so I'll just talk about both as I may go back to one version over the other.

## 3.4.1 Airtap (past)
- Standard cost: 2
- Value Neutral: not really
- Primarily favored in green, considered it for purple

So the earlier iterations of Airtap simply meant that the balloon could be spent like a breath card during your turn. if you come from an MTG background this is basically a mana dork.

This used to be a part of Green's Ramp package, and was first introduced in version 2 of balloonomancy. For the longest time though it kinda had issues of balance, noteable it encouraged green to be more of a wide ramp color when I wanted it to be more about going tall.

## 3.4.2 Airtap (current)
- Standard Cost: 1
- Value Neutral: yes
- Signature of green

Early on when I seriously started working on green in the 4th iteration, Airtap got reworked so that instead of creatures having it being mana dorks, breath counters they were carrying could be readily used to play cards on your turn.

This was in part of a grander direction towards incentivizing green to inflate stuff more, and give it an alternate form of ramp where it can store breath inside Airtap balloons and spend it later.

So far while the idea seemed neat on paper, I haven't yet seen it work out super great in practice. The current green deck doesn't really play into it too much, in some ways I'm wondering if I may want to go back to the old iteration of Airtap. still I want  to give this version a fair shake, and plus I can always make these two versions separate abilities with their own names.
