# 2.1 red style

Vibes:
- very athletics oriented 
- kind of a "pugilist" division as is mechanics mostly center around the player leaning almost exclusively on their own physical ability.
	- a lot of dodging and maneuvers
	- gestures and taunting 
	- reading and predicting the opponent 
	- grabbing and throwing balloons and stuff
- objects tend to be either fitness related or manually operated.
- tends to be more simple and fundamental, it's more about playing the dodgeball game ernestly.

Mechanics:
- is the tempo color 
	- wants the get the most bang for it's buck
	- values high/immediate board presence.
- likes strength+X to have balloons swing over rival balloons 
- like to force interaction with opponents boards.
	- can spend rival balloons to make them open for attack 
	- can attack balloons that are active.
- want all of its balloons to be able to attack.
- has the most efficient Dodge cards out of all the colors.
- likes to manipulate its stamina line to prepare Dodges in it.
- likes to have effects that trigger when it's balloons attack
- can remove rival objects.
