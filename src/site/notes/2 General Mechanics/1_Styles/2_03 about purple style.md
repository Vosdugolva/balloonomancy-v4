# 2.3 purple style 

## Vibes:
- much more of the arcane style of magic. This is more of that highfalutin magic studied by nerds.
	- scholars, wizards, those types of magic users.
	- the creators of the purple style are framed as being a bunch of nerds whose initial plans for balloonamancy was going to be something much more larpy. But now they have to play dodgeball.
	- Fire, Ice, and Lightning. Mostly fire though
	- Also psychic powers, Divination, and other non-elemental magics
- Balloons in Purple tend to be more abstract or inorganic.
	- I mean, Spellbeasts are literally elementals and animate spells
	- Also is where all the odd and/or creepy stuff is, though blue shares some too.
