# 2.0 about styles

Styles act as this games approach to card attributes that's serve to divide the mechanics up across different parts of the game. Much like MTG's colors or the civilizations of Duel Masters and kaijudo, or classes like in hearthstone.

Lore wise, styles are framed as being entire communities of players who have developed their own approach to the core game, with the cards representing the techniques and methods they use, and the balloons they've designed.

A lot of the card game's storytelling is centered on the sport and how the 4 styles interact with the core idea of it, and how they intermingle with each other.
