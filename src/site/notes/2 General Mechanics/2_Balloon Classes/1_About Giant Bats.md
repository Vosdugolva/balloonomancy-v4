# About Giant bats

![Broadnose4.png](/img/user/Broadnose4.png)

Giant bats are the first balloon class to be created within the sports history, in fact they arguably began with the sport. Early on when the original planners were working on their magic dueling sport, they had a lineup of sentient balloons to act as summoned creatures. and when their original plans got warped into the frantic game of dodging inflatable monsters, the bat balloons were a favorite choice for essentially being dodgeballs that can glide into enemy players.

This carries on with the giant bats that make up a large part of Red style games. though the versions made for the sport have a lot more girth than the bat balloons used in the proto sport. who were otherwise quite slim until players intentionally overinflated them to round them out more.

Giant Bats generally represent the swiftness and evasiveness of the Red style. these commonly have mechanics that support actions as well as manipulating the stamina line. and it's common for them to have abilities like evasive or speedy.
