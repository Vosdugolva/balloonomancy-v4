Balloons fashioned as powerful guardians of nature, animals of varying sizes adorn with runes and mystical features. these have become the baseline balloon class for the Green style of balloonomancy.

While all balloons are inflatable, Guardians take this above and beyond by being able to expand to gigantic proportions in order to tower over the opposition.

Guardians are the generalist balloon class for Green, they tend to be blockers and will often have BreathScale.

They also tend to have mana acceleration abilities, something shared with Wind Sages.
