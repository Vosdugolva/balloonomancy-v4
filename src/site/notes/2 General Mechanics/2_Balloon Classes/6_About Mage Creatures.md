Mystical familiars whose appearance range from creatures associated with high magic to simply being inflatable magicians. Mage creatures are balloons imbued with great magical power that provide assistance to their balloonomancer during the game, although these typically stay out of the heat of the fight.

Mage creatures are very big into on play effects and typically either support spellbeasts or provide functions related to card draw and deck manipulation.

The main shortcoming with mage creatures is that after they come in and do their thing, they're usually just vanilla balloons then. Some may have tap abilities but also have the downside of not being able to attack at all. And mage features pretty much never have blocker.

This is a characteristic of purple at large, purple generally has weak board presents because it's balloons either leave the board as soon as they do something, or they don't really do a whole lot on the board. This is a trait other purple balloon classes will have in some capacity.
