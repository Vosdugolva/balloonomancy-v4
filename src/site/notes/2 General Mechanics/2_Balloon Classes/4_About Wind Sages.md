Wind Sages are aesthetically similar to Guardians, but while Guardians represent the might of the natural world, Wind Sages represent the magic.

With appearances that range from shamanistic to druidic. Wind Sages are balloons that possess the power to manipulate air and wind. and leverage it to their advantage by controlling the air in other balloons.

Wind Sages Mainly interact with inflation and mechanics involving breath tokens. many of them have AirTap.

I've also thought about having them be the ones to manipulate cards in the players breath zone, but that may be a mechanic they share with Guardians, like ramp.
