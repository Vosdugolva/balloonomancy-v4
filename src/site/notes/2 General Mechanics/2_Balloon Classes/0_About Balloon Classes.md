# About Balloon Classes

So in Balloonomancy, Balloons are defined and categorized by their class. this is equivalent to creature races from other card games except they're driven more by a shared theme/aesthetic given that they are not only artificial but made by and for each of the styles they primarily exist in.

Each style has their own set of balloon classes, with each class serving as a means of expressing the major game mechanics and playstyles that color focuses on.

Balloons can have more than one class, and in the future I plan on playing with this for cross color mechanics.
